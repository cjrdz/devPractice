Takes two inputs from the user

First input: An integer (whole number like 1, 2, 3)
Second input: A float (decimal number like 1.5, 2.7, 3.9)

Multiply these two numbers together
Display the result of the multiplication
"""

#ASK THE USER  TO ENTER A NUMBER AND CONVERT IT TO FLOAT
NUMBER1 = float (input("Ingrese numero decimal : " ))

#ASK THE USER TO ENTER A NUMBER AND CONVERT IT TO INT 
NUMBER2 = int (input("Ingrese numero entero : " )) 

#Perform the multiplication betwen the decimal and the integer
MULTI = NUMBER1 * NUMBER2 

print("\n")

#show 
# Display the multiplication result on the screen
print( "Resultado de Multiplicacion : ", MULTI)
